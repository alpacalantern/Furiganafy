# Furiganafy
A basic tool that takes Japanese text with furigana in parenthesis 漢字(かんじ) and uses Ruby to place the furigana on top. Allows saving of PNG files, HTML snippets, and style/color changes.

I don't really know any HTML or JS or Ruby - I'm just giving instructions to Copilot and kinda moving things around on my own to make it all work, so if anyone finds and knows how to fix bugs, go for it :)

There's better tools out there but this one lets me edit the style and store things locally. 


##Usage
1. Get any text that has kanji and furigana in parentheses (ex. 私(わたし)は薬剤(やくざ)です。)
2. Paste it into the top-left text box. The script will pull the furigana out of the parentheses and place it over each kanji.
3. If there are kanji you already know, list them (comma-separated) in the right box to exclude them from furigana. You can also use the bottom box to allow it to give you furigana the first time you see certain Kanji, and 4. then never after seeing it that once.
4. You can resize the base text, furigana, colors and sizes and save your result as an HTML file or even a .PNG
